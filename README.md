# Creating the WPF chart with Azure open AI for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Creating a WPF chart that integrates with Azure OpenAI for data cleaning and preprocessing can significantly enhance the quality and presentation of your data. WPF's robust graphical capabilities allow developers to craft visually appealing and highly interactive charts, making it a popular choice for desktop applications that require sophisticated data visualization. Whether you are working with financial data, scientific metrics, or business analytics, WPF offers a wide range of chart types, from simple line and bar charts to more complex options like pie charts, scatter plots, and 3D visualizations. These charts can be easily customized to suit various themes and user preferences, providing an immersive experience for the end user.

This article illustrates how to clean and preprocess data using Azure OpenAI in conjunction with a Syncfusion WPF chart.
